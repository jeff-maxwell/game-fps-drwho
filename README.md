# Dr Who Game First Person Shooter

This game was a team project (Team Asteroids) for a Masters course in Computer Science at Oklahoma State University (OSU).  The design of the game was to create a first person shooter survival game against Daleks with 3 levels.  This project is a fork and a continuation of that project from class.
